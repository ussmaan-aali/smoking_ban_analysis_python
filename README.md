# Data analysis using python
## Importing Libraries: 
The necessary libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, were imported to support the analysis.
## Import Dataset: 
The dataset "SmokeBan_Dataset" from the specified file location was imported using the Pandas library.
## Exploring Data: 
The shape, head, value counts, and information of the dataset were examined to gain insights into the data structure and content.
## Data Preprocessing: 
The dataset columns were renamed, duplicated data was identified and removed, and the index was reset.
## Univariate Analysis: 
Bar plots were created to visualize the top and bottom age groups in the dataset, as well as the distribution of smokers and non-smokers.
## Feature Relationships: 
Bar plots were generated to analyze the top age groups of smokers and non-smokers, and a countplot was created to explore the relationship between smoking status and smoking policies in the workplace.
## Conclusion: 
Based on the analysis, it was observed that the dataset had a sampling bias towards individuals aged 28 to 40. The impact of smoking bans on employees and the distribution of smokers/non-smokers varied depending on the workplace's smoking policies.
